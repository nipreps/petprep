    caption: Results of performing susceptibility distortion correction (SDC) on the
      BOLD reference image. The "distorted" image is the image that would be used to
      align to the anatomical reference if SDC were not applied. The "corrected"
      image is the image that was used.

    caption: A T2* map was calculated from the echos. Here, we show the comparison
      of the T2* map and the BOLD reference map used for BOLD-T1w coregistration.
      The red contour shows the anatomical gray-matter mask resampled into BOLD space.

    caption: A histogram of estimated T2* values within the anatomically-derived gray-matter mask
      shown in the previous plot. Note that values are clipped at 100ms, so any extreme outliers will
      appear in the 100ms bin.

    caption: This panel shows the alignment of the reference EPI (BOLD) image to the
      anatomical (T1-weighted) image.
      The reference EPI has been contrast enhanced and susceptibility-distortion
      corrected (if applicable) for improved anatomical fidelity.
      The anatomical image has been resampled into EPI space, as well as the
      anatomical white matter mask, which appears as a red contour.
    static: false
    subtitle: Alignment of functional and anatomical MRI data (coregistration)
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: rois, suffix: bold}
    caption: Brain mask calculated on the BOLD signal (red contour), along with the
      regions of interest (ROIs) used for the estimation of physiological and movement
      confounding components that can be then used as nuisance regressors in analysis.<br />
      The <em>anatomical CompCor</em> ROI (magenta contour) is a mask combining
      CSF and WM (white-matter), where voxels containing a minimal partial volume
      of GM have been removed.<br />
      The <em>temporal CompCor</em> ROI (blue contour) contains the top 2% most
      variable voxels within the brain mask.<br />
      The <em>brain edge</em> (or <em>crown</em>) ROI (green contour) picks signals
      outside but close to the brain, which are decomposed into 24 principal components.

    caption: The cumulative variance explained by the first k components of the
      <em>t/aCompCor</em> decomposition, plotted for all values of <em>k</em>.
      The number of components that must be included in the model in order to
      explain some fraction of variance in the decomposition mask can be used
      as a feature selection criterion for confound regression.
    subtitle: Variance explained by t/aCompCor components
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: carpetplot, suffix: bold}
    caption: Summary statistics are plotted, which may reveal trends or artifacts
      in the BOLD data. Global signals calculated within the whole-brain (GS), within
      the white-matter (WM) and within cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) show the mean BOLD
      signal in their corresponding masks. DVARS and FD show the standardized DVARS
      and framewise-displacement measures for each time point.<br />
      A carpet plot shows the time series for all voxels within the brain mask,
      or if <code>--cifti-output</code> was enabled, all grayordinates.
      See the figure legend for specific color mappings.
      "Ctx" = cortex, "Cb" = cerebellum, "WM" = white matter, "CSF" = cerebrospinal fluid.
      "d" and "s" prefixes indicate "deep" and "shallow" relative to the cortex.
      "Edge" indicates regions just outside the brain.

      Left: Heatmap summarizing the correlation structure among confound variables.
      (Cosine bases and PCA-derived CompCor components are inherently orthogonal.)
      Right: magnitude of the correlation between each confound time series and the
      mean global signal. Strong correlations might be indicative of partial volume
      effects and can inform decisions about feature orthogonalization prior to
      confound regression.

      Summary statistics and global PET signal measures are presented.
      A carpet plot displays voxel-level PET tracer uptake over time within the brain mask. Global signals calculated across the whole-brain (GS), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) regions are plotted, along with DVARS and framewise displacement (FD) to visualize potential motion or acquisition artifacts.
      "Ctx" = cortex, "Cb" = cerebellum, "WM" = white matter, "CSF" = cerebrospinal fluid.
